Stack:  | X | Y     <- top of stack
        ---------

#1 -> create a node Z with the LHS name, push Z to stack
#1(input) -> create a node Z with the name 'input', push Z to stack
#2 -> pop X & Y, make Y right child of X, push X
#3 -> pop X & Y, make X left child of Y, push Y
#4 -> pop X & Y, X adopts Y's children, push X
#5 -> group all the Xs on top the stack with the same name under one Z
#6 -> delete Y
#7 -> if X has only one child, replace it with the child
